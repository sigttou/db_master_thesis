- Looking at tls_simple_server:
  - connection allows AES256GCM counter to be used.
    - Galois/Counter Mode, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5288 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode for more details.
    - Counter must somehow be stored in an SSL Object - https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/ssl/SSL_new.html
      - There is `unsigned char read_iv[EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH];` and `unsigned char write_iv[EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH];` in the ssl_struct
        - EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH is 16 (bytes)
      - These IVs are used and changed in `ssl/tls13_enc.c` and are part of an SSL connection.
