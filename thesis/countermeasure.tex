\chapter{Countermeasures}\label{sec:countermeasure}

For the countermeasures against rowhammer, we can only repeat what
Gruss~\etal~\cite{nethammer, flipinthewall} already said. It is a hardware fault
which vendors have to fix.

When looking at binary analysis and how we find the bitflips, it would help if
systems would use different ELF files per device, this would make it harder to
find flips working on all installed systems and each target would have to be
analysed on its own. This step would break with a lot of other security
properties. It is therefore not a recommended step to take as a countermeasure.
Compiler developers and developers of wide-spread software are currently working
on reproducible builds. Whereas the Debian close organisation
reproducible-builds~\cite{reprobuilds} is one of the most significant
contributors to this field. The advantage of reproducible builds is that all
binaries compiled with the same compiler, same configuration and same
source-code will not differ, this makes detection of changes very easy. The
technology allows a bit-by-bit compared verification of the full build chain
used for the program. So, also changes or backdoors introduces by a malformed
compiler or linker could be detected.

Reproducible builds could also help to define other countermeasures to bit flips
in the binary memory. Whereas the operating system can verify ELF files by using
stored checksums, it would also be possible to use similar techniques to do this
with in-memory code or data at runtime. As Suh~\etal~\cite{memintegrity} have
shown in their work about memory integrity verification and encryption for
secure processors. Other work that could be looked at as countermeasure is
DRIVE~\cite{drive} by Rein or SPEE~\cite{spee} by Gelbart~\etal. Those apply
code verification to binaries before execution and during runtime.

Encrypting ELF content and only decrypt it during execution would also fix the
problem of flips in the ELF file, as encryption would fail and execution would
be halted if a bitflip has occurred.
